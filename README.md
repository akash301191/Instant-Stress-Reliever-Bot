# Instant Stress Reliever Bot

Instant Stress Reliever Bot is a therapeutic Streamlit application designed to help users cope with stress and anxiety in the moment. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), OpenAI's GPT-4o, and Giphy, this bot uses cognitive reframing techniques to transform emotionally heavy reflections into comforting, supportive paragraphsâ€”each paired with a carefully selected, emotionally safe (well, not so safe. we are still refining this aspect) GIF.

## Features

* **Stress Input & Tone Selection**
  Describe your stress or anxiety, choose the type (e.g. relationship, work, health), and pick a response tone (e.g. gentle, uplifting, calm).

  The Emotional Reframe Agent reads your entry and generates 5 distinct, cognitively reframed paragraphs using affirming language and therapeutic tone.

* **Emotionally Safe GIF Suggestions**
  The Visual Enricher Agent enhances each paragraph with a supportive, meme-free GIF using Giphy search. All visuals are sensitive to user distress and intended to soothe, not entertain.

* **Structured Markdown Output**
  The final output is a markdown-formatted support report with paragraphs and embedded calming visuals.

* **Download Option**
